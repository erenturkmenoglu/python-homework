* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
According to Crunchbase, Riskalyze has acquired funding of $23.5M over 6 rounds from FTV Capital.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The specific problem that Riskalyze® aims to solve is the process of assessing the risk of an investment portfolio in an automated and personalized way. The broad customer base for Riskalyze is financial advisors as the work that the company does is very similar to what an advisor does and the service is free of charge for financial advisors. In addition to financial advisors, Riskalyze also targets the people who manage their own portfolios but charge them an asset-based fee for using the service. Differently from a financial advisor who does the work with his/her knowledge and expertise, Riskalyze automates this whole process and assigns a RiskNumber® to portfolios. This RiskNumber® is a value between 0 and 100 that gives insight about the Value-At-Risk of the portfolio. The less risky a portfolio is the closer the RiskNumber® to 0 and vice versa. With this innovative technology that the company developed, any individual around the globe can get an insight about their portfolio without the need of hiring a financial advisor.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Company’s targeted customers are financial advisors and portfolio managers. In my opinion, targeting financial advisors and offering the product free of charge to that specific customer base is a part of management strategy both for getting feedback from professional advisors about the product, and making the product widely known and available in the field. However, the other customer base; portfolio managers constitute of the main cash-generating customer base for Riskalyze. Since these portfolio managers can be any individual around the globe without a pre-determined level of expertise or amount of cash, there is a huge potential ahead. Also, instead of calculating the total available market based on number of users we need to make this calculation through total assets as the pricing is based on a 10-15 basis points of total assets in portfolio.

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
According to Kitces, Riskalyze is not only a wealth-tech vendor but also acts as an ETF manufacturer and has a high potential of growth into more fields such as building models and trading engines. In my view, the biggest competitors for Riskalyze are financial advisors because the work they are doing is transforming the old traditional market of human-advisors. What Riskalyze does differently from traditional human advisors is that they provide a faster, cheaper, and an innovative approach for risk assessment. Potentially in the future, they have the potential to bundle other offerings into the service they provide such as trading engines, building financial models, and portfolio building etc.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
What Riskalyze® does basically is to measure and reflect the whole risk of a portfolio as a single number. To get this number, a survey is provided to each user in order to assess their risk appetite. This is an essential part as each user would have different goals and risk tolerances when it comes to investing. The technology of quantifying the risk as a single digit called ‘Patented Single Number’ technology won a Nobel Prize in 2002. Thanks to this technology, financial advisors can precisely understand a customer’s risk appetite and create tailored portfolios for them if not making small adjustments.
Riskalyze’s offerings are not limited to only a Patented Single Number technology, they also offer a service called AutoPilot, which is an automated investment program allowing advisors to help manage the retirement and retail investment plans and accounts. 
In addition to AutoPilot and Patented Single Number technology, the platform also allows users to perform stress tests to showcase different scenarios such as market crash and rises or falls in interest rates. With the help of this technology, users can see the vulnerabilities of their portfolios before unlikely and unwanted scenarios occur. Based on the results of these scenarios the program gives advice  on how to cope with or mitigate the risk and builds the target portfolio.
Other technologies include Compliance Cloud services to automatically track an advisor’s book of businesses which sends an alert when  a regulation breach occurs.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
The domain that Riskalyze® leverages is investment management for risk assessment purposes. From one point of view the domain may also be robo-advising, but that is not the only service that Riskalyze® provides to its users. It aims to become a thorough platform where investors can assess their risks, research companies and industries through models, and create automated trading strategies. So, it is becoming an asset management platform in my understanding.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
As for the asset and wealth management domain, PWC’s global FinTech report states that the new focus operations and trends will include increased efficiency and innovation in research and analysis tools. Another article suggests that 81% of banks adopted technology in asset and wealth management to offer a better service to customers by creating a mobile application, yet this number is way below in asset managers at 31%. Furthermore, asset and wealth management platforms are improving in a way that they provide advice to users and become hybrid domain companies including robo-advising, as well as asset and wealth management.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
According to the article, asset and wealth management companies are leveraging automation by providing robo-advisors which are very similar to what Riskalyze® does. Another company with a very similar structure is Responsive.ai which is a hybrid wealth advisor solution for enterprises. Other high scale start-ups include that may potentially threat Riskalyze® are Robinhood, Acorn, fi360 ToolKit, and MorningStar Advisor Workstation. In addition to small innovative start-ups, there are big banks such as JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Charles Schwab helping their clients by digitalizing and making an easier experience of wealth management.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
This company’s business impact was an initial round of funding of $23.5M they received, and created a revenue of $35M annually with 170 employees. Apart from these financial values, innovations and trends that a company creates are also important factors when estimating the impact of a business. What Riskalyze® has achieved most importantly in my opinion is that they have created a hybrid domain company to  include both wealth and asset management, and robo-advising domains. With this, they are not only exponentially increasing their total available market, but also incorporating two different domains disruptively together and innovate.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
According to an article on opsdog.com, key performance indicators for investment management firms are listed as; assets per employee, client retention rate, clients per registered financial advisor, account on-boarding cycle time, trade error rate. Based on a different source on kitces, I found that financial advisors have 3 sections of KPIs; Client, Growth, and Firm Metrics. Some of the most important key performance indicators can be listed as net/operating profit margin, new amount/percentage revenue from existing clients, new amount/percentage revenue from new clients, distribution of revenue/client, client revenue/hour and profit/client.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
If I were the CEO of Riskalyze®, I would be interested in building a thorough platform for doing as much as different activities possible to be the only and complete solution for customers. This is already something similar to what Riskalyze is doing currently by creating a hybrid domain platform for asset/wealth management and robo-advising. It is not only a risk assessment tool but also a platform where people can research, learn and build strategies with models. Riskalyze® is also working on an auto-trading platform called AutoPilot allowing financial advisors to manage the clients’ retail and retirement accounts. I believe this is a very important innovation that we will start seeing the biggest developments in the following years in the field of auto-trading. If companies can promise their clients a pre-determined rate of return, and can achieve the same performance every time by relying on an algorithm, this would be a game changer in the whole industry and economy. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
I thought this product could be a good complementary with the services that are being offered already. Users would not need to go to a different platform to execute trades. Instead of replacing financial advising completely, an automated trading section would make the platform a more complete solution. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Automatic trading systems will need to be linked directly to a brokerage account. And specific rules and conditions need to be applied to the software so that the algorithm will know what to do when certain criteria are met.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
I believe this technology would make the platform a more complete solution. A person getting financial advice probably wants that information so he/she can make more informed investment decisions that maximizes profit. If the platform allows their users to automate investments based on their risk appetite from the same survey results.
