Assignment #18
In this project, I will create a testnet blockchain network for an imaginary company.
Below are the steps of this process:
- Set up a custom testnet blockchain
- Send a transaction
- Create a repo
- Write instructions on how to use the chain for the rest of the team

In order to set up a testnet, I will need to use the following tools we covered in FinTech bootcamp;
- Puppeth, to generate the genesis block
- Geth, a command-line tool, to create keys, initialize nodes, and connect nodes together
- The clique proof of authority algorithm
